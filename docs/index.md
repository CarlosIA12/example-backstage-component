This lambda serves the only purpose of being an example of how to use TechDocs, the code in it is merely an example hello world and if you find this months after it's creating it might be time to delete it.

## Created by Backstage
Please read how to create Techdocs documentation, it is done using markup and has a lot of neat options to structure several sections for it

## Getting started

Start writing your documentation by adding more markdown (.md) files to this
folder (/docs) or replace the content in this file.
